Converting my Brainstation capstone to use Redux and Mongoose. Made changes to how components are structured, added proper user system with authentication, and made it possible to edit and delete your schedules, medical list, and your profile. Changed over how the components were written to use hooks and be Redux friendly, as well as adding all Redux functionality for usage of state. Removed React classes, replaced with useState + changed lifecycle methods to utilize useEffect.

Make sure to use 'npm start' in /server directory, not main directory. 

Thank you for reading!
